Cater, Kathryn</p>\n\n<p>This is a beautiful and compelling duet for harp and melody instrument. We offer this piece in three versions. Please read the descriptions so that you can choose the best version to suit your performance purposes. In all versions, the melody parts are edited for dynamics, but not phrasing. This is a mature performance piece, so your soloist will easily be able to interpret their own phrasing.</p>\n\n<p>A beautiful piece to play in church settings, this evocative melody, believed to be written in the late 1500&apos;s, is not familiar as an Ave Maria, thus can be used for all occasions. Please choose the version you wish to order.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Lever Harp Version</strong><br>\nFor Lever Harp and melody instrument &#x2013; in the key of B flat, all the way through<br>\nC Melody instrument, lever version: in B flat, all the way through B flat<br>\nMelody Instrument, lever version: in C all the way through</p>\n\n<p>Your melody instrument can be flute, violin, clarinet, oboe, etc. The lever harp part does not have a key change, and remains in B flat throughout. It is very similar, but not identical, to the pedal harp score. The melody parts to go with the lever harp score also remain in one key. There are several lever changes in this piece, but the arrangement attempts to give ample time to make these changes.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Intermediate Pedal Harp, violin friendly (VF) version</strong><br>\nStarts in B Flat, modulates to C at m. 41<br>\nC Melody Instrument, pedal (VF), Starts in B Flat, modulates to C<br>\nB flat Melody Instrument, pedal (VF), Starts in C, modulates to D</p>\n\n<p>The key of Bb to C is a more suitable key for the violin and resonates better than the original version, which starts in the key of Ab. If you want a versatile score that is accessible to strings as well as woodwind melody instruments, the violin friendly B flat to C version is recommended.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Upper Intermediate Original version</strong><br>\nStarts in A flat, modulates to B flat for Pedal Harp<br>\nFLUTE &quot;original&quot; version: Starts in A flat, modulates to B flat CLARINET (B flat) &quot;original&quot; version: Starts in B flat, modulates to C</p>\n\n<p>This is exactly the way the Caccini Ave Maria is performed on Ms. Cater&#x2019;s CD &quot;A Merry Little Christmas&quot; and on her You Tube recordings.

Cater, Kathryn\n\nThis is a beautiful and compelling duet for harp and melody instrument. We offer this piece in three versions. Please read the descriptions so that you can choose the best version to suit your performance purposes. In all versions, the melody parts are edited for dynamics, but not phrasing. This is a mature performance piece, so your soloist will easily be able to interpret their own phrasing.\n\nA beautiful piece to play in church settings, this evocative melody, believed to be written in the late 1500's, is not familiar as an Ave Maria, thus can be used for all occasions. Please choose the version you wish to order.\n\nLever Harp Version\nFor Lever Harp and melody instrument – in the key of B flat, all the way through\nC Melody instrument, lever version: in B flat, all the way through B flat\nMelody Instrument, lever version: in C all the way through\n\nYour melody instrument can be flute, violin, clarinet, oboe, etc. The lever harp part does not have a key change, and remains in B flat throughout. It is very similar, but not identical, to the pedal harp score. The melody parts to go with the lever harp score also remain in one key. There are several lever changes in this piece, but the arrangement attempts to give ample time to make these changes.\n\nIntermediate Pedal Harp, violin friendly (VF) version\nStarts in B Flat, modulates to C at m. 41\nC Melody Instrument, pedal (VF), Starts in B Flat, modulates to C\nB flat Melody Instrument, pedal (VF), Starts in C, modulates to D\n\nThe key of Bb to C is a more suitable key for the violin and resonates better than the original version, which starts in the key of Ab.
