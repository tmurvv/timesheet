Research and development for Lyon &amp; Healy&#x2019;s Electroacoustic harp began in the early 1980s in response to performance harpists&#x2019; demands for amplified sound equal in clarity and quality of sound to their acoustic harps. The electroacoustic harp produces this sound through the use of transducers on each of the harp&#x2019;s strings. The transducers, mixdown module and preamp, specially designed for Lyon &amp; Healy, are constructed to transform the acoustical sound of the string into an electrical signal. The result of this technology is an amplified harp which emits a reproduction of an acoustic sound in its natural state-the classic Lyon &amp; Healy sound.For performance harpists who want the flexibility of both an acoustic and an amplified harp, there is Lyon &amp; Healy&#x2019;s Style 2000 Electroacoustic harp.

The Style 2000 features a resonant Sitka Spruce soundboard, giving it a similar feel and sound thus making the transition from acoustic to amplified a natural one. The gold-plated transducers are attached to the Electroacoustic harp with a Rosewood center strip. Because of this design, the harpist can perform either acoustically or fully amplified without a substantial compromise in the acoustic quality of sound.</p> <p>This harp is approximately 10 years old.&#xA0; It was restrung and regulated in January 2021.&#xA0; Price includes dust cover.</p> <p>Follow the link below to view acoustic and amplified samples from this amazing unique instrument:</p> <p>https://www.dropbox.com/sh/servog4wx1h0dwi/AADvZyVGOShTORMaAJPRTt28a?dl=0</p> </div> ","productMaker":"Lyon & Healy","productModel":"Style 2000 CG ElectroAcoustic","productType":"electric","productSize":null,"productImageUrl":"https://findaharp-api.herokuapp.com/assets/img/IMG_0655.JPG","divider":"00000000000000000000000"},{"id":"a2d12f00-2ad6-4ea7-ab8b-db43686409fa","sellerName":"HarpsEtc","sellerEmail":"harpsetc@gmail.com","sellerCountry":"San Francisco area","sellerRegion":"Pacific","sellerLat":"37.900690","sellerLong":"-122.061810","productTitle":"Lyon & Healy Style 26 Gold #14477","productPrice":"$47,000.00","productShortDesc":"Last restrung and regulated March 2021. 47 strings Height 74 1/4\" Soundboard width 21 5/8\" Weight 81 lbs A stately harp...","productLongDesc":" <div><p>Last restrung and regulated March 2021.&#xA0;</p> <p>47 strings<br> Height 74 1/4&quot;<br> Soundboard width 21 5/8&quot;<br> Weight 81 lbs</p> <p>A stately harp designed by Lyon &amp; Healy in the late 1800s, the Style 26 integrates nineteenth century Gothic revival styles with Renaissance detail.
