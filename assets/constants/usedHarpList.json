The harp is still perfectly playable but due to some existing issues with this harp, it is priced to allow the purchaser to make some suggested repairs. It is suggested that the harp be rerivited to solve the problem of loud pedal action and a repair to the bodybase frame on the player&apos;s left. There is also a fair amount of twist in the neck and wear on the finish.</p> <p>46 strings<br> Height 69&quot;<br> Soundboard width 16 1/4&quot;<br> Weight 65 1/2 lbs</p> <p>&#xA0;</p> <p>Because of the large size of this item, regular shipping rates do not apply.
