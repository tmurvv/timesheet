It was purchased in 2004 from Sylvia Woods Harps in California. The information received from Dusty Strings when inquiring about the serial number is as follows: “I see that your harp, serial #2861, was built in 1996 (an “oldie but goodie”!). This tells me that your harp uses our current string set (rather than the older style of strings for harps before 1992). I can also confirm that your tuning pins are the older friction style pins, rather than the newer threaded pins. This means that you don’t have to “back out” your pins before restringing, like you would do with our newer pins.” Comes with soft padded case, extra strings, tuning key, music stand that attaches to the pillar and assorted music books.","productMaker":"Dusty Strings","productModel":"FH36H","productType":"lever","productSize":36,"productFinish":"walnut","productImageUrl":"https://findaharp-api-staging.herokuapp.com/assets/img/orrDustyStringsFH36B.jpg","divider":"00000000000000000000000"},{"id":"84aae605-9144-43bc-b204-60bba4b1e3bd","sellerName":"Find a Harp","sellerEmail":"harp@harptisha.com","sellerCountry":"Calgary, Canada","sellerRegion":"Canada-West","sellerLat":"51.214380","sellerLong":"-114.466894","productTitle":"Pilgrim Ashdown, 34 strings","productPrice":"$1950usd","productLongDesc":"1994 Pilgrim Ashdown harp made in Wales.
