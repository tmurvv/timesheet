This harp will satisfy both the professional and the beginner with its resonance and power, and will please the most discerning eye with a tasteful display of fine woodworking.</p> <p>This harp is the same overall size as its well-loved 32-string predecessor, but now goes down to the low C in the bass. For playing comfort, Dusty Strings has added facets on the upper corners of the back. This &#x201C;hybrid-stave&#x201D; design provides the ergonomic benefits of our popular 36-string stave back harp at a portion of the cost.</p> <p>To keep the carrying size down, the FH34 includes an innovative stand that has removable feet and nestles into the base of the harp, attaching in seconds with the twist of a knob and without needing to turn the harp upside down.

The tone is warm and full and the higher-tension concert gut strings provide a shorter sustain than the &#x201C;typical&#x201D; Dusty Strings sound. This makes the Boulevard an ideal choice for classical repertoire and for players and students who want a feel similar to that of a pedal harp.</p> <p>Based on our popular Ravenna 34, the Boulevard features the same innovative and affordable construction technique, the comfortable stave back body, and the easily removable stand. We designed it to be as lightweight and portable as possible in a full-range harp, without sacrificing the quality of the hardware or the construction. The package includes a full set of Loveland sharping levers, tuning wrench, stand and CD34 case.</p> <p>The four-legged stand is quickly and easily removable without needing to turn the harp over, and comes apart to fit in the case pocket. It includes 5&#x201D; legs, but 8&#x201D; legs can be substituted if you prefer the harp to be situated higher up.</p> <p>The case is made of durable, water-resistant cordura with thick foam padding, a convenient shoulder strap and a multitude of pockets for your stand, music, extra strings and other accessories.</p> </div> ","productMaker":"Dusty Strings","productModel":"Boulevard Classic 34","productType":"lever","productSize":34,"productImageUrl":"https://findaharp-api.herokuapp.com/assets/img/DS_Boulevard_L.png","divider":"00000000000000000000000"},{"id":"da29be2e-2731-47ac-9593-fde67b6e60e9","sellerName":"HarpsEtc","sellerEmail":"info@harpsetc.com","sellerCountry":"San Francisco area","sellerRegion":"Pacific","sellerLat":"37.900690","sellerLong":"-122.061810","productTitle":"Lyon & Healy Chicago Petite 40 Mahogany #...","productPrice":"$9,500.00","productShortDesc":"Harp built in 2010, restrung and regulated in 2018 at Harps Etc.
