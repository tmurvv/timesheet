The sculpted vertical lines in the column are offset by soft arcs at the top. Angles in the base are restrained by a curved slope and beveled edges. The soundboard with single inlay edging features two subtle angles, giving the illusion of a bend and complementing the graceful design of the column. The architectural shape of the harp creates a unique and brilliant sound. Ornamented solid brass action plates add to the allure of this refined harp. The Style 30 is available in mahogany, walnut and ebony finishes and comes with a cover, tuning key and a 5-year limited warranty.",

This amazing Daphne 47 EX Walnut Concert Grande harp is 12 months old and the harp was purchased by a harpist after the harpist suffered a major health crisis and while it had been hoped returning to harping on a full size was possible, the issue is confirmed now by the news that the owner is no longer able to play pedal harp. We are representing this harp for sale. (This very nice harpist will enjoy harp in the future on a lever)  Impressions: The harp feels and looks absolutely brand new. It has not been played in but has an excellent starting point for the sound. It is even, with a bright tone, springy response, and is a lovely Daphne. No surprises, this is the Salvi quality and shown in the nice feel and new soundboard style of brilliant sound. The harp has responsive pedals, even tone, and appear 100% brand new. The harp was selected by a professional harpist and the pedals have no marks show and the harp appears as is if it was not used. Please call for sound test, films or Skype viewing!    The harp comes with the following free/included items: 1. A Salvi dust cover, light blue fabric with a logo 2. A tune key and a small Salvi faux leather bag 3. A carton box   A new Daphne 47 EX is $18,900 and this is a really great chance to have a practically brand new harp, of superior quality, at the price below a Chicago brand model. $17,500 here is a super value for the money.
