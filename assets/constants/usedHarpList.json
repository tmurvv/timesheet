The electroacoustic harp produces this sound through the use of transducers on each of the harp&#x2019;s strings. The transducers, mixdown module and preamp, specially designed for Lyon &amp; Healy, are constructed to transform the acoustical sound of the string into an electrical signal. The result of this technology is an amplified harp which emits a reproduction of an acoustic sound in its natural state-the classic Lyon &amp; Healy sound.For performance harpists who want the flexibility of both an acoustic and an amplified harp, there is Lyon &amp; Healy&#x2019;s Style 2000 Electroacoustic harp.

The Style 2000 features a resonant Sitka Spruce soundboard, giving it a similar feel and sound thus making the transition from acoustic to amplified a natural one. The gold-plated transducers are attached to the Electroacoustic harp with a Rosewood center strip. Because of this design, the harpist can perform either acoustically or fully amplified without a substantial compromise in the acoustic quality of sound.</p> <p>This harp is approximately 10 years old.&#xA0; It was restrung and regulated in January 2021.&#xA0; Price includes dust cover.</p> <p>Follow the link below to view acoustic and amplified samples from this amazing unique instrument:</p> <p>https://www.dropbox.com/sh/servog4wx1h0dwi/AADvZyVGOShTORMaAJPRTt28a?dl=0</p> </div> ","productMaker":"Lyon & Healy","productModel":"Style 2000 CG ElectroAcoustic","productType":"electric","productSize":null,"productImageUrl":"https://findaharp-api.herokuapp.com/assets/img/IMG_0655.JPG","divider":"00000000000000000000000"},{"id":"31ea54b1-fd92-4020-964b-fe448cc6aa8a","sellerName":"HarpsEtc","sellerEmail":"harpsetc@gmail.com","sellerCountry":"San Francisco area","sellerRegion":"Pacific","sellerLat":"37.900690","sellerLong":"-122.061810","productTitle":"Salvi Arianna Multi-Wood #5568","productPrice":"$25,000.00","productShortDesc":"Eye-catching woods are selected from all corners of the globe for these splendid inlays: from rosewood to olive, from ebony to maple.
