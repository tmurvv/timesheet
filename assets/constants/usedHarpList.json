The soundboard with single inlay edging features two subtle angles, giving the illusion of a bend and complementing the graceful design of the column.

Call for films! This amazing Daphne 47 EX Walnut Concert Grande harp is 12 months old and the harp was purchased by a harpist after the harpist suffered a major health crisis and while it had been hoped returning to harping on a full size was possible, the issue is confirmed now by the news that the owner is no longer able to play pedal harp. We are representing this harp for sale. (This very nice harpist will enjoy harp in the future on a lever)  Impressions: The harp feels and looks absolutely brand new. It has not been played in but has an excellent starting point for the sound. It is even, with a bright tone, springy response, and is a lovely Daphne. No surprises, this is the Salvi quality and shown in the nice feel and new soundboard style of brilliant sound. The harp has responsive pedals, even tone, and appear 100% brand new. The harp was selected by a professional harpist and the pedals have no marks show and the harp appears as is if it was not used. Please call for sound test, films or Skype viewing!    The harp comes with the following free/included items: 1. A Salvi dust cover, light blue fabric with a logo 2. A tune key and a small Salvi faux leather bag 3.
