For playing comfort, Dusty Strings has added facets on the upper corners of the back. This &#x201C;hybrid-stave&#x201D; design provides the ergonomic benefits of our popular 36-string stave back harp at a portion of the cost.</p> <p>To keep the carrying size down, the FH34 includes an innovative stand that has removable feet and nestles into the base of the harp, attaching in seconds with the twist of a knob and without needing to turn the harp upside down. For those who like a lower height, the harp balances beautifully on the ground without the stand.<em> </em></p> <p>This harp delivers a superb combination of performance, range and portability in an elegant and easy-to-manage harp.</p> <p>Standard shipping does not apply.&#xA0; Please contact Harps Etc. for shipping cost and details.</p> </div> ","productMaker":"Dusty Strings","productModel":"FH34","productType":"lever","productSize":34,"productFinish":"walnut","productImageUrl":"https://findaharp-api.herokuapp.com/assets/img/DS_FH34_18819_L.png","divider":"00000000000000000000000"},{"id":"df4573fc-da1c-476c-ad0f-da537d3a5995","sellerName":"HarpsEtc","sellerEmail":"info@harpsetc.com","sellerCountry":"San Francisco area","sellerRegion":"Pacific","sellerLat":"37.900690","sellerLong":"-122.061810","productTitle":"Lyon & Healy Style 30 Natural #7437","productPrice":"$13,000.00","productShortDesc":"Built in 1976.

The package includes a full set of Loveland sharping levers, tuning wrench, stand and CD34 case.</p> <p>The four-legged stand is quickly and easily removable without needing to turn the harp over, and comes apart to fit in the case pocket.
