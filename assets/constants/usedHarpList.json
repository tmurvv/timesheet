The tone is warm and full and the higher-tension concert gut strings provide a shorter sustain than the &#x201C;typical&#x201D; Dusty Strings sound. This makes the Boulevard an ideal choice for classical repertoire and for players and students who want a feel similar to that of a pedal harp.</p> <p>Based on our popular Ravenna 34, the Boulevard features the same innovative and affordable construction technique, the comfortable stave back body, and the easily removable stand. We designed it to be as lightweight and portable as possible in a full-range harp, without sacrificing the quality of the hardware or the construction. The package includes a full set of Loveland sharping levers, tuning wrench, stand and CD34 case.</p> <p>The four-legged stand is quickly and easily removable without needing to turn the harp over, and comes apart to fit in the case pocket. It includes 5&#x201D; legs, but 8&#x201D; legs can be substituted if you prefer the harp to be situated higher up.</p> <p>The case is made of durable, water-resistant cordura with thick foam padding, a convenient shoulder strap and a multitude of pockets for your stand, music, extra strings and other accessories.</p> </div> ","productMaker":"Dusty Strings","productModel":"Boulevard Classic 34","productType":"lever","productSize":34,"productImageUrl":"https://findaharp-api.herokuapp.com/assets/img/genericHarp.png","divider":"00000000000000000000000"},{"id":"602300c5-3299-4aca-a835-d72642a86941","sellerName":"HarpsEtc","sellerEmail":"info@harpsetc.com","sellerCountry":"San Francisco area","sellerRegion":"Pacific","sellerLat":"37.900690","sellerLong":"-122.061810","productTitle":"Lyon & Healy Style 15 Natural #483","productPrice":"$14,500.00","productShortDesc":"Last restrung and regulated September 2016.
