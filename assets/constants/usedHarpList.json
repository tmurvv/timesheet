She&apos;s an amazing little harp, less than six pounds, stunningly easy to carry and transport with a beautiful sound. I carried her for years in my hospital work and she&apos;s nicely broken in.</p> <br> <p>She has full Truitt levers and I added an extra padded, extra wide, easily removable guitar strap. She comes with a set of strings, tuning key and padded case. Her range is C below middle C to D 2 octaves above. She has a few dings, as one might expect from a working harp, but nothing that compromises her structure.</p> <br> <p>There is a slight shift in the knee-block. This was done by the harp maker and how I received the harp. For added strength, the harp maker added an extra wooden panel on the right side where the column and neck intersect. This has never affected the structure or playing of the harp but can be an aesthetic issue for some harpists. I have never had an issue with the knee-block shift and the neck is not twisted.</p> <br> <p>Pictures are available of the harp upon request, including the neck block, panel and &apos;dings&apos;.</p> <br> <p>If you are a harp therapist looking for a light weight, lovely sounding harp, are preparing for that work once the virus is under control or just looking for a light weight, great sounding harp, this is the harp for you.</p> <br> <p>I&apos;m willing to travel to within 90 minutes of Philadelphia to deliver this harp to you. I will not ship this harp since it is used and I would want any potential harpist to examine the harp closely prior to purchase. I am selling it for $1500 which is an incredible price given the cost of a new Blevins. Use &quot;Contact seller&quot; below to contact me for more pictures and I&apos;d be happy to Zoom with you to let you hear her.</p> ","productMaker":"Blevins","productModel":"Marie XP","productType":"lever","productSize":23,"productFinish":"walnut","productImageUrl":"https://findaharp-api.herokuapp.com/assets/img/BlevinsMarieXP.jpg","divider":"00000000000000000000000"},{"id":"572eb0fc-20c0-40bd-9258-ccad6d98f489","sellerName":"Harp Angel","sellerEmail":"harpangelharpist@gmail.com","sellerCountry":"AB, Canada","sellerRegion":"Canada-West","sellerLat":"51.0900","sellerLong":"-115.3442","productTitle":"Celtic Harp, 36 strings, Rharp Merlin","productPrice":"$3300usd","productLongDesc":"Celtic Harp, 36 strings, Rharp Merlin, with Loveland levers, with padded travel case, features 8-sided coopered maple staveback, Aircraft-quality birch soundboard (5 laminates per 1/8 inch), Baltic birch neck and column, Mahogany and nitrocellulose finish.
