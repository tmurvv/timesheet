This harp was a custom order with added high gloss protective finish and added soundboard hand painted decoration. While this was supposed to be a forever harp.. you know how that is... the owner has decided to upgrade even further and so this lovely piece is for sale to support her upgrade. It has all new strings and has had regular maintenance and regulation. The new price would be $23,000 + $2200 custom decoration (not the standard swirls but exquisite flowers and vines) and also the high gloss oil based finish in the region of $2000. This harp comes with the following free itmes:1. Salvi Velvet Dust Cover, tune key, carton box if needed for transport2. Vanderbilt 2 wheel dolly3.
