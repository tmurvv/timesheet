Cater, Kathryn</p>\n\n<p>An unusual trio of this beautiful hymn by William M. Runyan, who wrote the melody for the words which first appeared in 1956 Bap&#xAD;tist Hymn&#xAD;al: Of the writing process he sayd, This par&#xAD;ti&#xAD;cu&#xAD;lar po&#xAD;em held such an ap&#xAD;peal that I prayed most ear&#xAD;nest&#xAD;ly that my tune might car&#xAD;ry its mes&#xAD;sage in a wor&#xAD;thy way, and the sub&#xAD;se&#xAD;quent his&#xAD;to&#xAD;ry of its use in&#xAD;di&#xAD;cates that God an&#xAD;swered prayer. The poem is by Thomas O. Chisholm, an American Methodist pastor and teacher, who was also a poet and editor, born July 29, 1866. This is his most famous work.</p>\n\n<p>Kathryn Cater has brought the tempo down, and put the meter in 9. In the style of Debussy, it is very moving and impressive. The arrangement is simply outstanding.</p>\n\n<p>This arrangement contains both a pedal and lever arrangement, both upper intermediate, with accidentals. The trio instrumentation is: harp, flute and violin. There is a clarinet part included which can substitute for the violin part. The harp parts are bound in plastic spiral, the other instrumental parts are pull-out.</p>\n</div>\n\n                            \n            ","image":"https://www.harpsetc.com/images/thumbnails/280/365/detailed/8/90821_zv8v-bb.jpg","newused":"new","harptype":"lever harp","level":"intermediate"},{"id":"5994","category":"music","subcategories":["lever harp","other ensembles"],"subcategory":"lever harp","subsubcategory":"other ensembles","store":"harpsetc","title":"Ave Maria","price":"$8.00","description":"\n                                                    \n    <div><p>Caccini, Giulio /arr.

Please read the descriptions so that you can choose the best version to suit your performance purposes. In all versions, the melody parts are edited for dynamics, but not phrasing. This is a mature performance piece, so your soloist will easily be able to interpret their own phrasing.</p>\n\n<p>A beautiful piece to play in church settings, this evocative melody, believed to be written in the late 1500&apos;s, is not familiar as an Ave Maria, thus can be used for all occasions.

It is very similar, but not identical, to the pedal harp score. The melody parts to go with the lever harp score also remain in one key. There are several lever changes in this piece, but the arrangement attempts to give ample time to make these changes.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Intermediate Pedal Harp, violin friendly (VF) version</strong><br>\nStarts in B Flat, modulates to C at m. 41<br>\nC Melody Instrument, pedal (VF), Starts in B Flat, modulates to C<br>\nB flat Melody Instrument, pedal (VF), Starts in C, modulates to D</p>\n\n<p>The key of Bb to C is a more suitable key for the violin and resonates better than the original version, which starts in the key of Ab.

These levers are pre-set in the easy and early intermediate versions.

The difficulty varies, but most of the pieces are for advanced beginner to intermediate players.</p>\n\n<p>Many of the pieces require numerous lever changes within the music. To assist players who are not used to flipping levers, Sylvia has included a list of 15 pieces with no lever changes, and 7 pieces with just a few changes.</p>\n\n<p>To assist players of smaller harps, Sylvia has also included a chart showing the range needed for each piece.

You may have to play them an octave higher than written, but they will fit on your harp.</p>\n\n<p>Seven of the pieces have 2 separate arrangements: one for lever harp players who tune their harps to C, and another for lever harp players who tune their harps to 3 flats. Pedal harpists can play either version.</p>\n\n<p>The keys for harps tuned to C range from C to 2 sharps. The keys for harps tuned to flats range from 1 flat to 2 sharps.

These tunes also can hold their interest with very creative and fun melodies! The Andalusian has glissandos, PDLT and lots of triads in various forms. The Arabian is an easy one with a few triplets. Riding Sunflower is a cheerful waltz teaching scales, inversions, and arpeggios. The Horse In My Dreams is a gentle piece in 3/4 teaching expressive right hand and left hand rolled chords. Irish Pony is a spirited 4/4 piece with lots of drones played in different octaves as eighths and quarters. Old Paint has that very western trail riding theme kids will love. The Silver Unicorn is a stately 6/8 piece which teaches inversions and dotted 8ths and 16ths. This one would make a great recital piece. Prancing Pony Rag is a lighthearted jovial piece with a lively feel that doesn&apos;t need to be played quickly. Excellent teaching pieces.

There are no lever/pedal changes within any of these pieces. Options have been given to make these pieces suitable for most harps of 30 strings or more. It is my hope that you will interpret each piece with your own artistic sense. Chords may be straight or rolled as it suits the piece and your playing style.</p>\n\n<p>Titles are:</p>\n\n<p>Dying Tree &#x2013; presented in both Gm and Am, not difficult but with some 16th note passages and a few flourishing runs. This piece is flowing and linear, and you&#x2019;ll generally play one note at a time.</p>\n\n<p>Morning River &#x2013; presented in both Bb and C, page 2 has an important left hand which is supported by 16th notes in the RH. Page 1 is a lovely and slow melody.</p>\n\n<p>Blackberry Winter &#x2013; although the notes are not hard, the rhythm is challenging, but well worth the effort. Presented in both Gm and Am, this simple and almost lulling melody will stay in your memory.</p>\n\n<p>Garden Psalm &#x2013; a simple and straightforward hymn-like piece with parallel thirds in a portion of the right hand. Presented in both F and G, rocking back and forth between 2/4 and &#xBE;, solemn and joyful.</p>\n\n<p>Crazy Quilt &#x2013; presented in both Bb and G, Crazy Quilt is in a foot tapping 6/8 with a neat walking left hand that you will enjoy practicing.</p>\n\n<p>Whoo Cat &#x2013; presented in Gm and Am, this 6/4 piece is a laid back rhythmic work. Instructions are: cool jazz, never hurried. The notes are easy, and once you get into the groove of the laid back jazzy rhythm, you&#x2019;ll really enjoy playing this tune.</p>\n\n<p>Skyescraper &#x2013; presented in both Gm and Am, this piece has a compelling melody that you&#x2019;ll want to dig into and experiment with different dynamics.</p>\n\n<p>Alone on the Range &#x2013; in the key of G, this simple melody is sincere and from the heart. It is sometimes carried in the left hand. There are a few syncopated passages giving it a western flavor.</p>\n\n<p>FIRE! &#x2013; descending and ascending triplets, glissandi and triad chords. Not hard to play, but impressive and fiery.</p>\n\n<p>This book is worthy of use and enjoyment by lower intermediate players both young and not so young. These pieces are not difficult, but have great integrity both rhythmically and melodically. They tell stories and will keep the interest of the player while teaching harpistic techniques.

All pieces are named after family pets. Danny Solves the Mystery is a cute minor melody in 6/8 using both hands for the quick melody. Lullaby For Smokey is slow and sweet with a repetitive left hand accompaniment. Walkin&apos; Wally is like early 60&apos;s rock music! Left hand gets a cool walking bass, right hand has a fun syncopated melody. Just keep it slow, because poor Wally has very short legs (he&apos;s a Basset). Grumpy Dreams of Flying has mysterious glissandos and a whole note melody that is almost chant-like (Grumpy is a very lazy, fat cat). Chasing Buddy is perfect for the student who wants to play everything fast and loud -- very showy and not really hard! Baron&apos;s Blues is a slow jazz piece with clever lever settings. This is a great piece for teaching counting and syncopation. Forest Friends and Buckwheat&apos;s Baby are great for teaching running eighth notes, and the latter teaches left hand I, IV and V chords as well. Students will love all of these pieces!
